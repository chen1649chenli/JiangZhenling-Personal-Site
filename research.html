                  We examine the effectiveness of a customer loyalty program with a non-tiered reward structure. These
                  programs are often thought to have low rates of return. We use a unique data set consisting of all
                  transactions at a chain of hair salons from both before and after the implementation of the loyalty
                  program, which allows us to control for selection effects about which customers become members. We
                  quantify three components of customer behaviors change with loyalty program: spending, frequency of
                  visit and retention. Overall the loyalty program leads to an approximately 16 – 18% increase in customer
                  lifetime value, even after accounting for the cost of the program, meaning that the program has a
                  significant net benefit to the firm. The increase in customer lifetime value comes largely from reducing
                  the attrition rate, which decreases by 15 – 17%, compared to the 3 – 5% increase in frequency and the
                  very small change in spending. Our findings on frequency and spending are consistent with those in the
                  previous literature, which generally has focused on those two measures, but because we also account for
                  retention, our estimated total value of the non-tiered loyalty program is much larger than that found in the
                  previous literature.

                  We develop a dynamic search model to study how consumers search and make purchase decisions. Using
                  data from an online retail platform, we observe three robust behavioral patterns: 1) Within a consumer’s
                  search set, the first sampled option as well as the last one are more likely to be purchased than the ones in
                  the middle. 2) The conversion rate is convex increasing with the number of options sampled. 3) The clickthrough
                  rate and conversion rate of sellers are only weakly correlated. It is hard to rationalize these
                  behavioral patterns with traditional search models; therefore, we modify Weitzman’s sequential search
                  model and incorporate new behavioral factors that are shown to increase consumer valuation for the focal
                  product. Our model also allows a consumer’s expected value of buying from a seller before search to be
                  systematically different from the realized value after search. Model estimation shows that the proposed
                  model can generate the observed behavioral patterns and outperform other search models. Based on the
                  results, we investigate how an online retail platform can perform searched based retargeting by making
                  use of consumers search history. Two retargeting strategies are examined, targeted advertising that
                  reveals sellers’ hidden information, as well as targeted coupon that can be used on the focal product. We
                  show that the online retail platform, sellers as well as consumers all benefit from such searched based
                  retargeting strategies.

                  Using a large panel dataset with more than 23 million individuals in the U.S., we study consumers’
                  durable goods consumption response with bonus payment. We find that customers are more likely to
                  originate an auto loan around the month when they receive a bonus. Contrary to the prediction from the
                  economics theory of permanent income hypothesis, we identify a significant and economically
                  meaningful increase in auto loan origination even when the bonus recurs every year and is likely to be
                  anticipated. Moreover, bonus-induced loan origination also happens for individuals with high income
                  (i.e., annual income >= $100k) or a tiny bonus (i.e., bonus amount <= $500), which suggests that liquidity
                  constraints cannot fully explain our findings. Our results, however, are consistent with the behavioral
                  explanations from mental accounting and windfall theory from the psychology literature. While receiving
                  bonuses increase customers’ auto loan origination, this origination effect has an unintended consequence:
                  auto loans originated right around the bonus month have a higher delinquency rate than loans originated
                  at other times. The increase in delinquency primarily comes from consumers with low income or
                  subprime credit score. Our findings have strong managerial implications for financial institutions to
                  identify consumers who have needs for auto loans and those who are more likely to go delinquent in the
                  future.
