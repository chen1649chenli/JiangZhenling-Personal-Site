                  This paper studies price bargaining when both parties have digit bias when processing numbers, and shows a positive welfare implication of digit bias in bargaining. The empirical analysis focuses on the auto finance market in the U.S., using a large data set of 35 million auto loans. Incorporating digit bias in bargaining is motivated by several intriguing observations. The scheduled monthly payments of auto loans bunch at $9- and $0-ending digits, especially over $100 marks. In addition, $9-ending loans carry a higher interest rate and $0-ending loans have a lower interest rate than loans ended at other digits. I develop and estimate a Nash bargaining model that allows for digit bias from both consumers and finance managers of auto dealers. Results suggest that both parties perceive a steeper slope for larger ending digits and an extra gap between payments ending at $99 and $00 in their payoff functions. This model can explain the phenomena of payments bunching and differential interest rates for loans with different ending digits. I use counterfactual to show that, counter-intuitively, digit bias is beneficial for the party with the bias in bargaining. Consumers’ payments are reduced by $203 million in total and the aggregate payments of finance managers increased by $102 million because of own digit bias. I also quantify the economic impact of imposing non-discretionary markup compensation policies in indirect auto lending. I find that the payments of African American consumers will be lowered by $452 million and that of Hispanic consumers by $275 million.

                  We develop a dynamic search model to study how consumers search and make purchase decisions. Using
                  data from an online retail platform, we observe three robust behavioral patterns: 1) Within a consumer’s
                  search set, the first sampled option as well as the last one are more likely to be purchased than the ones in
                  the middle. 2) The conversion rate is convex increasing with the number of options sampled. 3) The clickthrough
                  rate and conversion rate of sellers are only weakly correlated. It is hard to rationalize these
                  behavioral patterns with traditional search models; therefore, we modify Weitzman’s sequential search
                  model and incorporate new behavioral factors that are shown to increase consumer valuation for the focal
                  product. Our model also allows a consumer’s expected value of buying from a seller before search to be
                  systematically different from the realized value after search. Model estimation shows that the proposed
                  model can generate the observed behavioral patterns and outperform other search models. Based on the
                  results, we investigate how an online retail platform can perform searched based retargeting by making
                  use of consumers search history. Two retargeting strategies are examined, targeted advertising that
                  reveals sellers’ hidden information, as well as targeted coupon that can be used on the focal product. We
                  show that the online retail platform, sellers as well as consumers all benefit from such searched based
                  retargeting strategies.

                  We examine the effectiveness of a customer loyalty program with a non-tiered reward structure. These
                  programs are often thought to have low rates of return. We use a unique data set consisting of all
                  transactions at a chain of hair salons from both before and after the implementation of the loyalty
                  program, which allows us to control for selection effects about which customers become members. We
                  quantify three components of customer behaviors change with loyalty program: spending, frequency of
                  visit and retention. Overall the loyalty program leads to an approximately 16 – 18% increase in customer
                  lifetime value, even after accounting for the cost of the program, meaning that the program has a
                  significant net benefit to the firm. The increase in customer lifetime value comes largely from reducing
                  the attrition rate, which decreases by 15 – 17%, compared to the 3 – 5% increase in frequency and the
                  very small change in spending. Our findings on frequency and spending are consistent with those in the
                  previous literature, which generally has focused on those two measures, but because we also account for
                  retention, our estimated total value of the non-tiered loyalty program is much larger than that found in the
                  previous literature.

                  Using a large panel dataset with more than 23 million individuals in the U.S., we study consumers’
                  durable goods consumption response with bonus payment. We find that customers are more likely to
                  originate an auto loan around the month when they receive a bonus. Contrary to the prediction from the
                  economics theory of permanent income hypothesis, we identify a significant and economically
                  meaningful increase in auto loan origination even when the bonus recurs every year and is likely to be
                  anticipated. Moreover, bonus-induced loan origination also happens for individuals with high income
                  (i.e., annual income >= $100k) or a tiny bonus (i.e., bonus amount <= $500), which suggests that liquidity
                  constraints cannot fully explain our findings. Our results, however, are consistent with the behavioral
                  explanations from mental accounting and windfall theory from the psychology literature. While receiving
                  bonuses increase customers’ auto loan origination, this origination effect has an unintended consequence:
                  auto loans originated right around the bonus month have a higher delinquency rate than loans originated
                  at other times. The increase in delinquency primarily comes from consumers with low income or
                  subprime credit score. Our findings have strong managerial implications for financial institutions to
                  identify consumers who have needs for auto loans and those who are more likely to go delinquent in the
                  future.

                The mobile shopping channel has emerged to represent a large portion of consumer online shopping
                 as an alternative to the traditional PC channel. In this paper, we investigate and quantify the
                  effect of different online shopping channels (Mobile vs. PC) on consumer search and purchase
                  decisions. This paper is motivated by a potentially concerning empirical observation that the
                  conversion rate on mobile channel is significantly lower than that on the PC channel. We test
                  against several hypotheses, including difference in search cost or transaction cost, and find
                  the hypothesis best supported by empirical evidence to be that consumers <i>endogenously</i> choose
                  which channel to browse. We build and estimate a model that includes channel choice in the
                  consumer search and purchase problem, and apply it in an online shopping context with both
                  mobile and PC channels available. We find that for an average consumer, it is easier to start
                  a search on mobile channel (through lower initial fixed search cost) but more difficult for
                  intensive search (through larger marginal search cost) than on PC channel. Therefore, the mobile
                  channel draws in a systematically different pool of consumers whose initial interest to
                  purchase are lower on average than consumers who choose to search from the PC channel.
                  Moreover, we study how consumer purchase history, mobile device features and demographics
                  affect their channel choice. With counterfactual analysis, we study the managerial implication
                  under the current evolution trend of mobile device features (such as larger screen size),
                  as well as the impact of channel specific pricing on retail profit.

                  in Auto Finance Market Leveraging Natural Experiments (with Tat Chan and Naser Hamdi)</p>
                <a href="#abstract_6" data-toggle="collapse">Abstract &raquo</a>
                <div id="abstract_6" class="collapse">
                  This paper studies the impact of pricing discretion for auto dealers in indirect auto loan market.
                  Pricing discretion arises through a controversial dealer compensation practice through interest mark-up,
                  which is alleged to lead to discriminatory pricing for disadvantaged groups. With data observation of
                  auto loans from all banks, and natural experiments where banks switched to non-discretionary compensation
                  policy, we study the impact for consumers, auto dealers and banks. Price dispersion drops sharply upon
                  policy change. However, the previously disadvantage group does not necessarily benefit because of the
                  dealer choice problem in a channel setting – dealers choose to present a loan contract from several
                  banks to consumers according to dealers’ objective function. Using counterfactual analysis, we further
                  explore the effects from potential policy change such as requiring all banks to switch to non-discretionary compensation policy.
